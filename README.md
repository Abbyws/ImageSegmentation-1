ImageSegmentation
=================

An image segmentation project, using clustering algorithms.

This project was developed for the purposes of the course 'Machine Learning' of cs department, Athens University of Economics and Business, 
during the Spring semester 2013 - 2014.

It uses the KMeans and Expectation-Maximization algorithm, for splitting the image into clusters and then re-creates the image using the mean values found.

For running the KMeans implementation, run the script ML_KMeans, or ML_EM for the Expectation-Maximization implementation.
