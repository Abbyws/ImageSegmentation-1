ImageSegmentation
=================

An application that is used for image segmentation(i.e to display an image with less colors that it actually has by creating clusters of colors). The number of colors to display in the segmented image is user-defined.
In order to develop this project, some clustering algorithms were used, such as K-means and Expectation-Maximization

In order to run the KMeans implementation, run the script ML_KMeans, or ML_EM for the Expectation-Maximization implementation.
