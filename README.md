ImageSegmentation
=================

An application that is used for image segmentation(i.e to display an image with less colors that it actually has by creating clusters of colors). The number of colors to display in the segmented image is user-defined.
For achieving the above goal, the application uses the two most famous clustering algorithms, K-means and Expectation-Maximization

In order to run the KMeans implementation, run the script ML_KMeans, or ML_EM for the Expectation-Maximization implementation.
